## Template 2: Missing Pre-Shared Key Information

**Title:** Request for Missing Pre-Shared Key (PSK)

**Description:** Use when PSK is missing from the VPN tunnel configuration request.

**Comment:**

```java
Hello Team,

We are currently reviewing your VPN tunnel configuration request. However, we have identified that the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) information is missing from the submitted details.

To proceed with the VPN tunnel setup, please provide:

• Pre-Shared Key (PSK) - Required for authentication
• Confirm PSK matches on both ends (Customer side and SAP side)
• If this is a new tunnel, please provide a secure PSK meeting complexity requirements (minimum 20 characters, alphanumeric with special characters recommended)

Please note: For security purposes, we recommend sharing the PSK through a secure channel or encrypted method.

Once we receive this information, we will proceed with the configuration immediately.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

## Template 3: Downtime Request for Policy-Based VPN Changes

**Title:** Downtime Window Request - Policy-Based VPN Modification

**Description:** Use when changes to policy-based VPN will cause connectivity disruption (encryption domain, peer IP, etc.).

**Comment:**

```java
Hello Team,

We have reviewed your request for modification to the VPN configuration (Addition/Removal/Modification of encryption subnet/host/Peer IP/BGP ASN).

Important Note: During this configuration change, there will be a temporary connectivity loss as this is a policy-based VPN tunnel.

To minimize business impact, please provide TWO preferred downtime windows (1-2 hours each) between Monday to Friday when we can perform this activity:

Downtime Window 1:
• Start Time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]
• Estimated End: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]

Downtime Window 2:
• Start Time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]
• Estimated End: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]

Please ensure the timezone is clearly specified (e.g., UTC, EST, CET) and use 24-hour format.

We will coordinate with you to confirm the final maintenance window once we receive your response.

Thank you for your cooperation.

## Template 4: Downtime Request for Route-Based VPN Changes

**Title:** Downtime Window Request - Route-Based VPN Modification

**Description:** Use for route-based VPN changes where connectivity loss is minimal but downtime window is still recommended.

**Comment:**

```java
Hello Team,

We have reviewed your request for modification to the IKEv2 Route-Based VPN tunnel configuration.

We note that you currently have a route-based VPN with [Peer IP] and have requested changes to the encryption subnets.

Technical Note: Since this is a route-based VPN, the addition/removal of encryption subnets typically should not cause connectivity loss. However, as a best practice and to ensure zero business impact, we recommend scheduling a brief maintenance window.

Please provide TWO preferred downtime windows (1-2 hours each) between Monday to Friday:

Downtime Window 1:
• Start Time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]
• Estimated End: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]

Downtime Window 2:
• Start Time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]
• Estimated End: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Timezone]

Please ensure timezone is clearly specified (e.g., UTC, EST, CET) using 24-hour format.
